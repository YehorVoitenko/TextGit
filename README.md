# TextGit ðŸ™Œ
<br>
<h2>ðŸ“’Project description</h2>

<p>TextGit is a Python console application that allows users to create and track different versions of text files using Git. The application leverages Git's branching and merging capabilities to enable users to create and switch between different versions of their text files easily.</p>
<p>With TextGit, users can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create new text files and track them with TextGit</li>
  <li>Save new versions of their text files and switch between them</li>

</ul>
<br>

<h2>ðŸ›  Technologies Used</h2>
<p><code>async</code> TextGit is built using Python and utilizes the  programming paradigm. </p>
<p><code>black</code>The codebase is formatted using 'black', a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style.</p>

<br>
<h2>ðŸš€ Future Plans</h2>
<p>While TextGit is currently a console application, the long-term goal is to develop a web-based interface(<code>DRF</code>) that provides a more user-friendly experience. The web application will still leverage Git's capabilities and allow users to create and manage their text files and their versions.</p>
<p>The web application will also include additional features, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborative editing and version control for teams</li>
  <li>Integration with other Git-based tools and services</li>
  <li>View the history of their text files and their changes</li>
  <li>Revert back to previous versions of their text files</li>
  <li>Integration TextGit in Microsoft Offices apps</li>

</ul>
<p>Overall, the goal of TextGit is to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to manage their text files and their versions, while leveraging the power and flexibility of Git.</p>
